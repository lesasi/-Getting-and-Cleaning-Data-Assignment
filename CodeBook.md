## Information on 'tidy_data_summary' data table  
 
### Identifiers and averages of features
 
The first 2 variables, 'subject' and 'activity', can uniquely identify each row of the table. The other 66 variables are the averages for some selected features- those which contain information on means and standard deviations, from the original dataset: 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0' - a dataset with 561 vairables initially.

### How to load 'tidy_data_summary' data in R 
 
It order to load the 'tidy_dataset' in R correctly,
use the following command:
 
```
tidy_dataset <- read.table(file = "tidy_dataset.txt",
                                header = TRUE) 
```
### About 'tidy_data_summary' table 

This dataset was created for the needs of: 

> Course 3: 'Getting and Cleaning Data', by 'Johns Hopkins University' on Coursera 

Before trying to reproduce it, the following notes should be taken into account:
 
  - The data used for the download was accessed by the script '[download_dataset.R](https://github.com/lesasi/-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment/blob/master/download_dataset.R)',  from the url: "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"
    as of 15th May, 2020.
  - The data was then processed by the script '[run_analysis.R](https://github.com/lesasi/-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment/blob/master/run_analysis.R)' to create the 'tidy_data_summary' table.
  - The scripts were made using R(version 3.6.1).
  - The library 'dplyr' version 0.8.0.1  was used.
  - The library 'data.table' version 1.12.2  was used.

## The process by which the 'tidy_dataset' table was produced

In order to produce the 'tidy_dataset' table, the script  '[run_analysis.R](https://github.com/lesasi/-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment/blob/master/run_analysis.R)' was created and used. 
 It performs the following tasks: 
   
 #### Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set with target variables. 
   
  1. Combines data from these files, 
       - UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt 
       - UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt 
       - UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt 
 
     into the 'train set' that contains the human subject, the activity performed and the values of the features. 
  2. Combines data from these files, 
       - UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt 
       - UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt 
       - UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt 

     into the 'test set' that contains the human subject, the activity performed and the values of the features. 
  3. Combines the data frames created for test set and train set into one large dataset.

 #### Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 
  1. Finds the target features, which are the features with measurements about mean and standard deviation, and extracts them as well as those that indicate the 'subject' and 'activity' and creates a new data table only with the target variables. 
 
 #### Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.   

  1. Replace the variable about activity, that contains integers from 1 to 6, with a factor based on the levels and labels contained in the 'activity_labels' data file. 
 
 #### Appropriately labels the data set with target variables with descriptive names. 
 
  1. Extracts the target variable names from 'features.txt'.
  2. Fixes a small mistake in the feature names - a few names in 'features.txt' contain 'BodyBody' instead of 'Body'. 
  3. Creates a new tidy dataset with the appropriate labels for the variable names.

 #### From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

  1. Group the tidy data table created in step 4, by 'subject' and 'activity'. 
  2. Summarize each variable to find the average for the grouped values. 
  3. Ungroup the data table. 
  4. Add descriptive names to the variables of the new tidy data table by adding the prefix 'Avg-' in the names of the target feature averages.
  5. Write the data in a text file in the present working directory, by the command: 
    
     ```
     write.table(tidy_dataset, "tidy_dataset.txt", row.names = FALSE) 
     ```

## Description of the features on which the averages were based 
 
### Information on how the features were produced from the raw data 
 
The selected features were produced, as it is explained in the
'features_info.txt' file of the original data set:
 
> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
>
> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also, the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
>
> Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
>
>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  -XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

> tBodyGyroMean  
> tBodyGyroJerkMean  
> 

### Information on the collection of raw data 
 
The raw signals were produced, as it is explained in the 'README.txt' file of
original data set:
   
> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities: (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
>
>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
>The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window,
a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 
> 
> #### For each record it is provided: 
> 
> - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration)
and the estimated body acceleration. 
> - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
> - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
> - Its activity label. 
> - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 
 
and also it include the following notes: 

> Notes: 
> 
> - Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. 
> - Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
